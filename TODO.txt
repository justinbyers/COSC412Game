TODO List:

- Speed up / Slow down button feature
- rightCol (middleRow) section with tower / selected tower info
- bottomRow section with premium features (boosts, boons, etc)
- More towers
- Diverse mobs (shapes)
- Diverse mobs (color/type (fast, slow, more hp))
- Change title name and visual to something more creative
- make gradient circular colors for the shock and ice towers
- revert slow tower particles, or create a better particle (upgraded tower has too much junk shooting out)




Completed:
- make shock tower less squiggly
- arrow to indicate where the wave starts from
