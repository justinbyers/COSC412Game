TODO List:

- Speed up / Slow down button feature
- rightCol (middleRow) section with tower / selected tower info
- bottomRow section with premium features (boosts, boons, etc)
- Diverse mobs (shapes)
- Diverse mobs (color/type (fast, slow, more hp))
- Change title name and visual to something more creative
- make gradient circular colors for the shock and ice towers
- revert slow tower particles, or create a better particle (upgraded tower has too much junk shooting out)

- fix tower info section to update in real time (currently must reclick tower to update info)
- starting arrow direction bolds when laser tower attack (wtf??? prob something to do with .lineWidth somewhere)

Completed:
- revisit slow tower design
- make shock tower less squiggly
- arrow to indicate where the wave starts from
