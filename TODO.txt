TODO List:
- Change title name and visual to something more creative
- bug: placing towers near start and insta-killing mobs makes waves speed by
        (potential fix is on line 1370, where the mob delay is. perhaps track # of mobs TO be spawned, then subtract that # from mobskilled and mobsescaped)

- Clicking main menu will cause the game to skip difficult selection (not sure why, honestly dont care to figure it out)
        workaround: just fuckin reload the file instead of going to main menu lmaoo
- Need premium shop additions

Completed:
- revisit slow tower design
- make shock tower less squiggly
- arrow to indicate where the wave starts from
- starting arrow direction bolds when laser tower attack (wtf??? prob something to do with .lineWidth somewhere)
- rotate arrows to face correct directions for each map
- pause/resume feature
- rightCol (middleRow) section with tower / selected tower info
- revert slow tower particles, or create a better particle (upgraded tower has too much junk shooting out)
- fix tower info section to update in real time (currently must reclick tower to update info)    
- bug: losing all lives OR completing the # of waves (5 for easy, 10 med, 15 hard), and then restarting = game still frozen    

Dropped:
- make gradient circular colors for the shock and ice towers                                         found better design
- Diverse mobs (shapes)                                                                              lacking time to implement 
- Diverse mobs (color/type (fast, slow, more hp))                                                    lacking time to implement 
- bottomRow section with premium features (boosts, boons, etc)                                       implemented elsewhere (shop)
- Speed up / Slow down button feature                                                                not extremely important
